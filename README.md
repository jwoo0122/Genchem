# Genchem

## General chemitry course information site for KAIST

2017 Fall Semester

This project is part of SPARCS project 'Genchem'.
First project with Adobe XD. Very useful tool, but it have few features. It's so difficult to use..

## What this repo means?

Here are all the file I made in 'Genchem' Project. I managed UI / UX Design. All File is .xd File.
And also I study JS (React.JS) with this project, so there would be some .js file, maybe.
